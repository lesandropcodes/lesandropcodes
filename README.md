### Hi. I'm Lesandro Ponciano :handshake:

I research and teach Human-Computer Interaction, Cooperative Systems, Scientific Methodology, and other cool things in the area of Information Systems and Software Engineering.

Yes, you are right. I love both computers and people. I also love science and education :nerd_face:. 

You're right again.  Even after completing my PhD thesis in 2015, I still code, less often than I would like, but I code.
